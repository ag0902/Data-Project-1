Data source 2: [LAPD Arrest Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/arrest-data-from-2020-to-present)
Data source 3: [New York City average temperature](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/city/time-series/USW00094728/tavg/1/0/2024-2024)
Data source 4: [Los Angeles average temperature](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/city/time-series/USW00023174/tavg/1/0/2024-2024)
